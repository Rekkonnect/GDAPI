# Archival

This project was left behind. 2.2 features weren't integrated, performance wasn't up to par and features were incomplete or missing. The architecture was also bound to undergo a rework. I lost complete motivation and have since moved on from the game, and as such this project remains untouched. If you wish to enhance this project, feel free to fork it and make your own modifications and releases on NuGet, abiding to the declared license.
